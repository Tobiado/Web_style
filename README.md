# Web_style
A simple web page style, so you need to change text, files and information acording to your personal needs.

Insert text, header, title or contact information via places that read "Insert header/Insert text/Insert email ...

Insert images to web page via places that read "Insert image name and form". You may also create a Images folder, then add the folder name infront of the image name and form.

Insert videos to web page via places that read :Insert image name and form" You need to download the video into the "Videos" folder.

You may connect the page with a google form, that can work as a shop for customers, simply after creating a google form, insert the google form link via places that read "Insert link to google form"

You may change other settings if you wish, like image size or document language, you may also insert or remove aditional br to align text better.
 
I hope that the style is useful :)
