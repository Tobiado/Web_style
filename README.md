A simple web page style :)

Insert text, header, title or contact information via places that read "Insert header/Insert text/Insert email ...
Insert images to web page via places that read "Insert image name and form". You need to download the image into the "Images" folder.
Insert videos to web page via places that read :Insert image name and form" You need to download the video into the "Videos" folder.
You may connect the page with a google form, that can work as a shop for customers, simply after creating a google form, insert the google form link via places that read "Insert link to google form"
You may change other settings if you wish, like image size or document language, you may also insert or remove aditional "<br>" to align text better.
